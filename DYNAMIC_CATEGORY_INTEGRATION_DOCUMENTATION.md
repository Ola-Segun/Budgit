## 3. Architecture Improvements and Design Decisions

### Clean Architecture Preservation
- **Layer Separation**: Maintained strict domain/data/presentation separation
- **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies flow inward (UI → Domain → Data)
- **Interface Contracts**: Repository interfaces define clear contracts

### Reactive State Management
- **Riverpod Integration**: Used for reactive state management across features
- **Provider Listening**: Automatic UI updates when underlying data changes
- **State Consistency**: Single source of truth for category data

### Dynamic Category System Design
- **ID-based References**: All features reference categories by ID, not enum values
- **Centralized Management**: Single category management system serves all features
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new categories without code changes

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Migration Support**: Safe transition from hardcoded to dynamic categories
- **Default Categories**: Pre-populated categories maintain existing functionality
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even with missing category references

### Error Handling Architecture
- **Result Pattern**: Consistent error handling across all operations
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery options
- **Operation States**: Loading, success, and error states for all operations

## 4. Integration Points and Reactive Updates

- **Data Integrity**: No data loss during migration process

### Existing Functionality Preservation
- **Budget Operations**: All existing budget functionality works unchanged
- **Transaction Operations**: Transaction creation and management unaffected
- **UI Consistency**: Existing screens continue to work with dynamic categories

### Graceful Degradation
- **Missing Categories**: System handles cases where referenced categories don't exist
