Based on my analysis of the existing budget implementation and the requirements for simplicity, functionality, and immediate value delivery, here's the prioritized feature roadmap:

PHASE 1: Core Budget Management (Immediate Implementation - High Impact)
1. Budget Creation & Basic Tracking ‚úÖ Already Implemented
Custom budget creation with category allocation
Basic spending tracking against budgets
Real-time budget status calculation
Visual progress indicators
2. Budget Alerts & Notifications ‚úÖ Already Implemented
Configurable alert thresholds (75%, 90%, 100%)
Push notifications for budget warnings
Visual health indicators (healthy/warning/critical/over-budget)
3. Budget List & Overview ‚úÖ Already Implemented
Budget cards with spending progress
Active vs inactive budget filtering
Search and filter capabilities
Quick actions (edit/delete via swipe)
PHASE 2: Enhanced User Experience (Next Priority - Medium Impact)
4. Budget Detail View Enhancement
Missing: Budget rollover functionality (mentioned in analysis but not implemented)
Missing: Budget editing screen (referenced but not found in codebase)
Enhancement: Better transaction integration in budget details
Enhancement: Spending pattern insights
5. Budget Templates
Missing: Pre-built budget templates (Zero-based, 50/30/20, Envelope)
Missing: Template selection during budget creation
6. Advanced Filtering & Search
Enhancement: Filter by budget type, date range, status
Enhancement: Advanced search with multiple criteria
PHASE 3: Advanced Features (Future Enhancement - Lower Priority)
7. Budget Analytics & Insights
Missing: Spending pattern analysis (trends, unusual transactions)
Missing: Budget optimization recommendations
Missing: Historical budget performance
8. Budget Sharing & Collaboration
Missing: Multi-user budget sharing
Missing: Collaborative budget management
9. Advanced Budget Types
‚úÖ COMPLETED: Post-creation transaction tracking (budgets now track only transactions made after budget creation date)
Missing: Recurring budgets with automatic rollover
Missing: Goal-based budgets with target dates
Missing: Account-specific budget filtering
Key Findings & Recommendations
‚úÖ Strengths (Already Working Well)
Solid Foundation: Core budget creation, tracking, and alerts are fully implemented
Good Architecture: Clean separation of concerns with domain-driven design
User Experience: Intuitive UI with progress indicators and health status
Integration: Well-integrated with existing transaction system
‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps (High Priority Fixes)
Budget Editing: Edit screen is referenced but missing from codebase
Budget Rollover: Analysis shows rollover logic but implementation is incomplete
Templates: Template system designed but not implemented in UI
üìà Enhancement Opportunities (Medium Priority)
Analytics: Basic insights could be expanded with trends and recommendations
Advanced Filtering: Current filtering is basic, could be more sophisticated
Implementation Priority Matrix
Feature	Impact	Effort	Priority	Status
Budget Editing Screen	High	Low	Critical	Missing
Budget Rollover	High	Medium	Critical	Incomplete
Budget Templates	Medium	Medium	High	Missing
Enhanced Analytics	Medium	High	Medium	Basic
Advanced Filtering	Low	Low	Low	Basic
**NEW FEATURE COMPLETED: Post-Creation Transaction Tracking**

‚úÖ **Successfully implemented budget feature where budgets track only transactions made after budget creation date.**

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Added `createdAt` timestamp field to Budget entity and DTO
- Updated transaction filtering logic in `CalculateBudgetStatus` to only include transactions after budget creation
- Added date/time picker in budget creation screen with explanatory text
- Added creation date editing in budget edit screen with warning dialog about data implications
- Integrated creation date selection with template-based budget creation
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing budgets

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `Budget` entity to include `createdAt: DateTime` field
- Updated `BudgetDto` with corresponding Hive field
- Enhanced `CalculateBudgetStatus._getCategorySpending()` to filter by creation date
- Added UI components for date/time selection in both creation and edit screens
- Updated template creation flow to support creation date specification

**User Experience:**
- Clear indication that budgets track post-creation transactions
- Warning dialogs when editing creation dates to prevent accidental data changes
- Intuitive date/time picker interface
- Template integration maintains creation date functionality

Recommendation: Focus on completing the critical missing pieces (budget editing and rollover) before adding new features. The current implementation already provides excellent core functionality that delivers immediate value to users.
